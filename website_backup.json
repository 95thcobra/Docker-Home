Some people want nostalgia and to be able to  AFK grind for\nlevels and a traditional world is best for them but there  are certain things\nthat for me make the game slow and insufferable as a  regular player. I want to\nexplore the difficulty of speed PKing and have  a more casual experience be\npossible.\n\nWe are not going to have different code bases to have all of this be  possible.\nInstead, we will simply allow the server operator to toggle  which features they\nwant enabled in their config.xml file with a section  for non-traditional\nfeatures.\n\nHave any other interesting ideas that could enhance the fun world that other\nservers have done / you always wanted to see?","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/08/dragons.png","featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5b65049bca7b810001ef4e5e","created_at":"2018-08-03 02:40:14","created_by":"5b65049bca7b810001ef4e5e","updated_at":"2018-08-03 15:55:46","updated_by":"5b65049bca7b810001ef4e5e","published_at":"2018-08-03 14:42:24","published_by":"5b65049bca7b810001ef4e5e","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b65116c40b7b10001185cb5","uuid":"cce00781-d235-4671-8eb5-96458a003dc8","title":"Play Now","slug":"play-now","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://discordapp.com/invite/94vVKND\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://localhost:8080/downloads/Open_RSC_Launcher.jar\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre10-downloads-4417026.html\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0,1],2,\"-> Join the Discord chat 🔪\"],[1,[],0,0],[0,[0,2],2,\"--> Download the game launcher 🐺\"],[1,[],0,1]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Not able to open the game launcher? \"],[0,[3],1,\"Get the latest Java runtime environment here.\"],[1,[],0,2],[1,[],0,3],[0,[],0,\"If you are using OpenJDK on Linux, run this command first: \\\"\"],[0,[0],1,\"sudo apt install openjfx\"],[0,[],0,\"\\\"\"]]]]}","html":"<p><strong><a href=\"https://discordapp.com/invite/94vVKND\">-&gt; Join the Discord chat 🔪</a></strong><br><strong><a href=\"http://localhost:8080/downloads/Open_RSC_Launcher.jar\">--&gt; Download the game launcher 🐺</a></strong><br></p><hr><p></p><p>Not able to open the game launcher? <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre10-downloads-4417026.html\">Get the latest Java runtime environment here.</a><br><br>If you are using OpenJDK on Linux, run this command first: \"<strong>sudo apt install openjfx</strong>\"</p>","amp":null,"plaintext":"-> Join the Discord chat 🔪 [https://discordapp.com/invite/94vVKND]\n--> Download the game launcher 🐺\n[http://localhost:8080/downloads/Open_RSC_Launcher.jar]\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNot able to open the game launcher?
